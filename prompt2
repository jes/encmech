Every word or phrase that should be a link to its own article should be formatted as a hyperlink like [some topic](#some_topic). Since our encyclopedia has a page for every single topic, please use these hyperlinks liberally. Everything that could be a link to its article should be.

Lots and lots and lots and lots of links! Make sure the hyperlinks don't have spaces in, underscores are fine. The text of the link should have spaces where appropriate, just not the link target.

It is very important that you put links *everywhere* possible.

Please modify the article to insert links in *every phrase* that could *conceivably* be a link. Even if you think it doesn't make a lot of sense.
